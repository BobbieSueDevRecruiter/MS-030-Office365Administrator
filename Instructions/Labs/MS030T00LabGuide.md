#### **Scenario**

Adatum Corporation is considering moving some of the core on-premises services such as Exchange Server and SharePoint Server to Office 365. The project steering committee needs to ensure that   
‎Office 365 can provide the required functionality and accommodate the corporate security and compliance requirements. To get started, Adatum Corporation has decided to begin a pilot deployment of Office 365 for a group of users in the London office. 

As one of the most experienced IT admins at Adatum Corporation, you are responsible for implementing the pilot project. To start, you need to configure the Office 365 tenant, and then configure the custom domain that your organization uses. You also need to ensure that you are comfortable with the Office 365 administrator interfaces.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure an Office 365 tenant.

- Configure a custom domain.

- Explore the Office 365 administrator interfaces.

 **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual.   
‎Your instructor will provide the lab documentation.

## Module 2 Lab A: Managing Office 365 users and passwords

#### **Scenario**

After configuring an Office 365 tenant and preparing it for pilot deployment, you are now ready to start creating user and group accounts in Office 365. You and your team need to be familiar with how to configure these accounts by using the Microsoft 365 admin center because this will be your primary tool for managing the environment after the deployment is fully functional. Additionally, you need to make sure that the password policy for Office 365 users matches the password policy for on-premises users.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
